# Car_plate_detection

Download the model and save it in a folder.

Download the dataset from my roboflow page abd save it in the folder as well

Download the "indian_license_plate" cascader

Download the model_test.ipynb file to test the model on your selected images

Please note: - The model is not very accurate in drawind the bounding box and even segmenting the plate from car

Due to this low accuracy, please try to input clear images of car with number plate
